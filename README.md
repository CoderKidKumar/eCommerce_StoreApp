## What this project is about?
This capstone project is not to solve a particular problem, but it is created to explore a full stack concept by creating a ecommerce site. This ecommerce site will be selling clothes, but not only is this project just going to simulate a ecommerce website, it will also have an admin page within to add, edit, or delete items and users. This will allow to show a functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. Almost just like Shopify, we can have the admin to make any changes to their items and it will show up on the application. 
This project originated from other projects at GCU, like creating blogging websites or a simple to do list, so to take those ideas and concepts to create a fully functional ecommerce site.

## What are the objectives of this project?
* Create a ecommerce website that has a fully functional homepage, product page, product info page, user settings page, cart, and checkout page.
* Create a dashboard that allows for an admin to view all the products within the site – which also allows for the admin to add, edit, or delete products. 
* Allow for the entire application (both user and admin ends) to be adjustable to any window size or device.

## What benefits and/or opportunities will come out from this project?
* Brings an opportunity to become a full stack web developer
* This benefits to strengthen my front end and back end skills, especially through PHP.

## Technology Covered During This Project
*	Heroku – this is the cloud service that will allow for the app to be online
*	GitHub – this is where my project files will be kept and updated
*	Microsoft Visual Studio Code – this is the choice of code editor
*	PHP (v. 8) – the application is focused on PHP to allow for frontend and backend communication
*	Bootstrap (v. 4) – this is a CSS framework that will allow to create frontend stylings very quickly
*	HTML5 – this is a language that will allow to build the web page elements
*	SQL – this is a language that will allow to make requests to a database to add, edit, view, or delete data
*	MAMP – a tool that allows for me to create MySQL databases locally on my desktop and have a local server where my PHP code can run on
